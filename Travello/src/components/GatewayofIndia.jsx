              The Gateway of India holds immense historical significance, as it marked the first point of entry for British officials visiting India. It later became a site of symbolic importance during India's independence, witnessing the departure of the last British troops from the country in 1948. Today, it stands as a reminder of India’s colonial past and the country’s journey to independence.
